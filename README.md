# Warehouse Robot Project

## Introduction

The Warehouse Robot project is a TypeScript application that simulates a robot moving in a 10x10 grid. The robot accepts commands to move north (N), south (S), east (E), and west (W), and it does not move outside the grid boundaries.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

## Running Tests
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```
   
## Notes
Modify `src/index.ts` to experiment with different robot command sequences.
The robot's initial position is at the southwest corner of the grid (coordinates 0,0).
